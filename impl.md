# ZenML Prompt Abstraction Implementation Plan

## Overview

This implementation aligns prompt management with ZenML's core philosophy:
- Prompts as first-class artifacts
- All operations through pipelines and steps
- Native experiment tracking using ZenML patterns
- No custom analytics or management systems

## Key Changes

### 1. Remove Analytics Components ✅
- [x] Remove `prompt_analytics.py`
- [x] Remove `prompt_manager.py` 
- [x] Clean up imports in `__init__.py`
- [x] Remove analytics methods from `Prompt` class

### 2. Simplify Core Prompt Class ✅
- [x] Keep only essential fields and methods
- [x] Remove all analytics integration
- [x] Focus on template formatting and validation
- [x] Maintain artifact compatibility
- [x] Update materializer to match

### 3. Create Utility Functions (Not Steps) ✅
- [x] Keep existing operations in `prompt_utils.py`
- [x] Format prompt with variables
- [x] Create prompt variants
- [x] Compare prompts
- [x] Validate templates

### 4. Build Comprehensive Example ✅
- [x] Create example directory: `examples/prompt_engineering/`
- [x] Pipeline 1: Prompt Development Pipeline
  - Create prompt variants
  - Evaluate with real LLM (OpenAI/Anthropic)
  - Compare results
- [x] Pipeline 2: Prompt Comparison Pipeline
  - Test multiple prompts
  - Track metrics using ZenML
  - Select best performing prompt
- [x] Pipeline 3: Experimentation Pipeline
  - LLM-as-Judge evaluation
  - Advanced prompt testing
- [x] Pipeline 4: Few-shot Pipeline
  - Compare zero-shot vs few-shot
- [x] Use actual LLM SDKs in steps
- [x] Show ZenML experiment tracking

### 5. Documentation ✅
- [x] Detailed README with end-to-end walkthrough
- [x] Code comments explaining ZenML patterns
- [x] Integration examples with OpenAI/Anthropic
- [x] Example prompt templates (JSON files)

## Implementation Summary

### What Was Removed
- All analytics classes and functionality
- A/B testing implementation
- Complex manager classes
- Performance metrics tracking (moved to pipeline steps)
- Many optional fields from Prompt class

### What Was Kept/Added
- Core Prompt class with essential fields
- Template formatting and validation
- Prompt comparison utilities
- Rich materializer with visualization
- Comprehensive examples showing best practices

### Key Design Decisions
1. **Steps in Examples Only**: All step implementations are in the examples, not in core ZenML
2. **Utility Functions**: Common operations are utilities, not steps
3. **LLM Integration**: Direct use of OpenAI/Anthropic SDKs in example steps
4. **Experiment Tracking**: Using ZenML's native experiment tracking instead of custom analytics
5. **Template Runs**: Examples show how to run experiments with different configurations

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**: Run the examples to ensure they work correctly
2. **Integration Tests**: Add tests for the simplified prompt abstraction
3. **Documentation Review**: Ensure all docs reflect the simplified approach
4. **Migration Guide**: Create guide for users migrating from analytics-heavy version
