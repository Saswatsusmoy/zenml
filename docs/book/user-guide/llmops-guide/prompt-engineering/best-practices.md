# Best Practices

This page compiles lessons learned from production teams using ZenML's prompt engineering features at scale. These practices are derived from real-world usage, user research, and common pitfalls we've observed.

## Version Management

### Semantic Versioning Strategy

Use meaningful version numbers that communicate the scope of changes:

```python
# ✅ Good: Semantic versioning with clear meaning
prompt_v1_0_0 = Prompt(
    template="Answer: {question}",
    version="1.0.0"  # Major: Fundamental approach
)

prompt_v1_1_0 = Prompt(
    template="Answer this question: {question}",
    version="1.1.0"  # Minor: Enhanced wording
)

prompt_v1_1_1 = Prompt(
    template="Answer this question clearly: {question}",
    version="1.1.1"  # Patch: Small refinement
)

# ❌ Avoid: Arbitrary or cryptic versions
prompt_bad = Prompt(
    template="Answer: {question}",
    version="prompt_tuesday_v3"  # Unclear what changed
)
```

### Git Integration Patterns

Store prompts alongside your code for proper version control:

```python
# prompts/customer_service.py
"""Customer service prompt templates."""

class CustomerServicePrompts:
    """Centralized prompt definitions."""
    
    @staticmethod
    def basic_response(version: str = "2.1.0") -> Prompt:
        """Standard customer response prompt."""
        return Prompt(
            template="""You are a friendly customer service representative for {company}.

Customer: {customer_message}

Please provide a helpful response that:
- Addresses their specific concern
- Offers concrete next steps
- Maintains a professional but warm tone""",
            version=version,
            variables={"company": "our company"}
        )
    
    @staticmethod
    def escalation_response(version: str = "1.3.0") -> Prompt:
        """Prompt for escalated customer issues."""
        return Prompt(
            template="""You are a senior customer service specialist handling an escalated issue.

Issue summary: {issue_summary}
Customer history: {customer_history}
Previous attempts: {previous_attempts}

Provide a comprehensive resolution plan that:
- Acknowledges the customer's frustration
- Takes ownership of the issue
- Provides a clear path to resolution
- Includes compensation if appropriate""",
            version=version
        )
```

### Change Documentation

Document what changed and why in your commit messages:

```bash
# ✅ Good commit messages
git commit -m "prompts: improve customer service response clarity (v2.1.0)

- Added specific instruction for concrete next steps
- Clarified tone expectations (professional but warm)
- A/B tested with 1000 customer interactions, 15% improvement in satisfaction"

# ❌ Poor commit messages  
git commit -m "update prompt"
git commit -m "prompt v3"
git commit -m "fix"
```

## Template Design

### Keep Templates Focused

Each prompt should have a single, clear purpose:

```python
# ✅ Good: Focused on one task
email_classification_prompt = Prompt(
    template="Classify this email as: URGENT, NORMAL, or LOW_PRIORITY\n\nEmail: {email_content}",
    version="1.0.0"
)

sentiment_analysis_prompt = Prompt(
    template="Analyze the sentiment of this text as: POSITIVE, NEUTRAL, or NEGATIVE\n\nText: {text}",
    version="1.0.0"
)

# ❌ Avoid: Multiple tasks in one prompt
multi_task_prompt = Prompt(
    template="Classify this email (URGENT/NORMAL/LOW), analyze sentiment (POS/NEU/NEG), and suggest a response: {email}",
    version="1.0.0"
)
```

### Use Clear Variable Names

Make variable names self-documenting:

```python
# ✅ Good: Clear, descriptive variable names
legal_review_prompt = Prompt(
    template="""Review this {document_type} for potential legal issues.

Document content: {document_content}
Jurisdiction: {legal_jurisdiction}
Review focus: {review_focus_areas}

Provide analysis for: {required_analysis_sections}""",
    version="1.0.0"
)

# ❌ Avoid: Cryptic or generic names
bad_prompt = Prompt(
    template="Review {x} for {y} in {z} focusing on {a}",
    version="1.0.0"
)
```

### Provide Sensible Defaults

Set defaults that work for 80% of use cases:

```python
# ✅ Good: Sensible defaults reduce friction
support_prompt = Prompt(
    template="""You are a {role} for {company_name} helping with {issue_type}.

Customer issue: {customer_issue}

Provide a {response_style} response with {detail_level} detail.""",
    version="1.0.0",
    variables={
        "role": "helpful customer support agent",
        "company_name": "our company",
        "issue_type": "general inquiry",
        "response_style": "professional and empathetic",
        "detail_level": "appropriate"
    }
)
```

## Testing Strategies

### Representative Test Cases

Use real user scenarios, not artificial examples:

```python
# ✅ Good: Real customer scenarios
real_test_cases = [
    {
        "inputs": {"customer_issue": "I can't log into my account and I have an important meeting in 30 minutes"},
        "expected_tone": "urgent_helpful",
        "expected_elements": ["immediate assistance", "alternative solutions", "follow-up"]
    },
    {
        "inputs": {"customer_issue": "I love your product but have a small suggestion for improvement"},
        "expected_tone": "appreciative_receptive", 
        "expected_elements": ["thank you", "value feedback", "next steps"]
    }
]

# ❌ Avoid: Artificial test cases
artificial_test_cases = [
    {"inputs": {"customer_issue": "test issue 1"}},
    {"inputs": {"customer_issue": "test issue 2"}}
]
```

### Business-Relevant Metrics

Measure what matters to your business:

```python
def calculate_business_metrics(response: str, customer_context: dict) -> dict:
    """Calculate metrics that matter to the business."""
    return {
        # Customer satisfaction indicators
        "politeness_score": evaluate_politeness(response),
        "empathy_score": evaluate_empathy(response), 
        "helpfulness_score": evaluate_helpfulness(response, customer_context),
        
        # Operational efficiency
        "response_length": len(response.split()),
        "action_items_count": count_action_items(response),
        "escalation_needed": needs_escalation(response),
        
        # Brand consistency
        "tone_alignment": evaluate_brand_tone(response),
        "terminology_consistency": check_brand_terms(response)
    }

# ❌ Avoid: Metrics that don't drive decisions
def poor_metrics(response: str) -> dict:
    return {
        "character_count": len(response),
        "word_count": len(response.split()),
        "sentence_count": response.count('.')
    }
```

### Statistical Rigor

Ensure sufficient sample sizes for reliable decisions:

```python
@step 
def production_ab_test(
    prompt_a: Prompt,
    prompt_b: Prompt,
    min_sample_size: int = 100,
    confidence_level: float = 0.95
) -> dict:
    """Run production A/B test with statistical rigor."""
    
    # Collect sufficient samples
    results_a = collect_samples(prompt_a, min_sample_size)
    results_b = collect_samples(prompt_b, min_sample_size)
    
    # Statistical analysis
    significance_test = perform_statistical_test(
        results_a, results_b, confidence_level
    )
    
    # Business impact analysis
    business_impact = calculate_business_impact(results_a, results_b)
    
    return {
        "statistical_significance": significance_test,
        "business_impact": business_impact,
        "recommendation": make_recommendation(significance_test, business_impact),
        "sample_sizes": {"prompt_a": len(results_a), "prompt_b": len(results_b)}
    }
```

## Production Deployment

### Environment-Specific Prompts

Use different prompts for different environments:

```python
import os

@step
def get_environment_appropriate_prompt() -> Prompt:
    """Get prompt appropriate for current environment."""
    env = os.getenv("ENVIRONMENT", "development")
    
    if env == "production":
        return Prompt(
            template="Provide a professional response to: {query}",
            version="2.1.0"  # Stable, well-tested
        )
    elif env == "staging":  
        return Prompt(
            template="Please provide a professional and helpful response to: {query}",
            version="2.2.0-rc1"  # Release candidate
        )
    else:
        return Prompt(
            template="[DEV] Response to: {query}",
            version="2.2.0-dev"  # Development version
        )
```

### Gradual Rollout Strategy

Deploy new prompts incrementally:

```python
@step
def gradual_prompt_rollout(
    current_prompt: Prompt,
    new_prompt: Prompt,
    rollout_config: dict
) -> Prompt:
    """Gradually roll out new prompt based on configuration."""
    
    rollout_percentage = rollout_config.get("percentage", 0.0)
    user_segments = rollout_config.get("segments", [])
    
    # Segment-based rollout
    if user_segments and get_user_segment() in user_segments:
        return new_prompt
    
    # Percentage-based rollout
    if random.random() < rollout_percentage:
        log_metric("prompt_version", new_prompt.version)
        return new_prompt
    else:
        log_metric("prompt_version", current_prompt.version)
        return current_prompt
```

### Monitoring and Alerting

Monitor prompt performance in production:

```python
@step
def monitor_prompt_performance(
    prompt: Prompt,
    response: str,
    user_feedback: dict = None
) -> None:
    """Monitor prompt performance and alert on issues."""
    
    # Performance metrics
    response_time = time.time() - start_time
    response_length = len(response)
    
    # Quality indicators
    quality_score = evaluate_response_quality(response)
    user_satisfaction = user_feedback.get("satisfaction") if user_feedback else None
    
    # Log metrics
    log_metrics({
        "prompt_version": prompt.version,
        "response_time": response_time,
        "response_length": response_length,
        "quality_score": quality_score,
        "user_satisfaction": user_satisfaction
    })
    
    # Alert on issues
    if quality_score < 0.7:
        alert("Low quality response detected", {
            "prompt_version": prompt.version,
            "quality_score": quality_score
        })
    
    if response_time > 5.0:
        alert("Slow response time", {
            "prompt_version": prompt.version,
            "response_time": response_time
        })
```

## Team Collaboration

### Code Review Process

Include prompts in your standard code review process:

```python
# Pull request template should include:
"""

"""
```

### Documentation Standards

Document prompt decisions and rationale:

```python
class DocumentedPrompts:
    """Customer service prompts with full documentation."""
    
    @staticmethod
    def basic_response() -> Prompt:
        """
        Basic customer service response prompt.
        
        Purpose: Generate helpful responses to general customer inquiries
        
        History:
        - v1.0.0: Initial version, basic response structure
        - v1.1.0: Added empathy language, 8% satisfaction improvement
        - v2.0.0: Restructured for clarity, 15% improvement in resolution rate

        - Occasionally too verbose for simple questions
        - Consider splitting into basic/detailed variants
        
        Next planned improvements:
        - Add dynamic length adjustment based on question complexity
        - A/B test more conversational tone
        """
        return Prompt(
            template="""You are a friendly customer service representative.

Customer: {customer_message}

Please provide a helpful response that:
- Addresses their specific concern
- Offers concrete next steps  
- Maintains a warm, professional tone""",
            version="2.1.0"
        )
```

### Shared Prompt Libraries

Create reusable prompt libraries for your team:

```python
# shared_prompts/common.py
class CommonPrompts:
    """Shared prompts used across multiple services."""
    
    @staticmethod
    def polite_refusal(version: str = "1.0.0") -> Prompt:
        """Standard polite refusal for requests we can't fulfill."""
        return Prompt(
            template="""I understand you'd like {requested_action}, but I'm not able to {limitation_reason}.

Instead, I can help you with:
- {alternative_1}
- {alternative_2}
- {alternative_3}

Would any of these alternatives work for you?""",
            version=version
        )
    
    @staticmethod
    def information_gathering(version: str = "1.0.0") -> Prompt:
        """Standard prompt for gathering additional information."""
        return Prompt(
            template="""I'd be happy to help you with {request_topic}.

To provide the most accurate assistance, could you please provide:
{required_information}

This will help me give you a more personalized and helpful response.""",
            version=version
        )
```

## Performance Optimization

### Prompt Length Optimization

Balance detail with performance:

```python
# Monitor prompt performance by length
@step
def optimize_prompt_length(prompt: Prompt, performance_data: dict) -> Prompt:
    """Optimize prompt length based on performance data."""
    
    current_length = len(prompt.template)
    avg_response_time = performance_data["avg_response_time"]
    quality_score = performance_data["avg_quality_score"]
    
    # If too slow and quality is good, try shorter version
    if avg_response_time > 3.0 and quality_score > 0.8:
        return create_shorter_version(prompt)
    
    # If fast but poor quality, try more detailed version
    elif avg_response_time < 1.0 and quality_score < 0.7:
        return create_longer_version(prompt)
    
    return prompt  # Current version is optimal
```

### Caching Strategies

Cache formatted prompts for repeated patterns:

```python
from functools import lru_cache

@lru_cache(maxsize=1000)
def get_cached_formatted_prompt(template: str, **kwargs) -> str:
    """Cache frequently used prompt formattings."""
    prompt = Prompt(template=template, version="1.0.0")
    return prompt.format(**kwargs)

# Use in high-frequency scenarios
def handle_common_request(request_type: str, user_data: dict) -> str:
    """Handle common requests with cached prompts."""
    if request_type == "greeting":
        return get_cached_formatted_prompt(
            "Hello {name}, welcome to {service}!",
            name=user_data["name"],
            service="our platform"
        )
```

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Over-Engineering

```python
# ❌ Avoid: Complex prompt management systems
class OverEngineeredPromptManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.prompt_cache = {}
        self.version_tree = {}
        self.approval_workflow = {}
        self.audit_log = {}
    
    def create_prompt_with_approval_workflow(self, template, approvers, metadata):
        # 100+ lines of complexity...
        pass

# ✅ Do: Simple, focused approach
def get_current_prompt() -> Prompt:
    """Get current production prompt."""
    return Prompt(
        template="Answer: {question}",
        version="1.0.0"
    )
```

### Perfectionism Paralysis

```python
# ❌ Avoid: Endless optimization without deployment
def perfect_prompt_development():
    """Don't fall into this trap."""
    while True:
        prompt = create_new_version()
        test_results = extensive_testing(prompt)
        if test_results["perfection_score"] < 100:
            continue  # Never ships!

# ✅ Do: Good enough to ship, then iterate
def iterative_improvement():
    """Ship and improve."""
    prompt = create_good_enough_version()  # 80% quality
    deploy_to_production(prompt)
    
    while True:
        feedback = collect_production_feedback()
        improved_prompt = make_small_improvement(prompt, feedback)
        ab_test_result = test_in_production(prompt, improved_prompt)
        
        if ab_test_result["is_better"]:
            prompt = improved_prompt
            deploy_to_production(prompt)
```

### Ignoring User Feedback

```python
# ✅ Do: Build feedback loops into your prompts
feedback_aware_prompt = Prompt(
    template="""You are a helpful assistant. 

User request: {user_request}

Please provide a helpful response. After your response, ask:
"Was this helpful? How could I improve my response?"

Response:""",
    version="1.0.0"
)
```

## Key Takeaways

1. **Simplicity wins**: Teams using simple Git-based versioning outperform those with complex systems
2. **Test with real data**: Artificial test cases don't predict real performance
3. **Measure business impact**: Focus on metrics that drive business decisions
4. **Deploy incrementally**: Gradual rollouts reduce risk and enable quick recovery
5. **Document decisions**: Future you will thank present you for good documentation
6. **Collaborate actively**: Include prompts in code reviews and team processes
7. **Optimize for iteration speed**: Fast feedback loops beat perfect first attempts

## Production Checklist

Before deploying prompts to production:

- [ ] **Version properly tagged** with semantic versioning
- [ ] **A/B tested** with statistically significant sample size
- [ ] **Business metrics improved** over current version
- [ ] **Error handling** implemented for edge cases
- [ ] **Monitoring and alerting** configured
- [ ] **Rollback plan** documented and tested
- [ ] **Team reviewed** and approved changes
- [ ] **Documentation updated** with rationale and performance data

Following these practices will help you build robust, scalable prompt engineering workflows that deliver real business value while avoiding common pitfalls that derail many LLMOps projects.
