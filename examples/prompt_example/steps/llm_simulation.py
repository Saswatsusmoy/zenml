1. **Definition and Context**
Microservices architecture is a software design approach where applications are built as a collection of loosely coupled, independently deployable services.

2. **Key Benefits with Explanations**
- **Scalability**: Individual services can be scaled based on demand
- **Technology Diversity**: Teams can choose optimal tools for each service
- **Fault Isolation**: Failures in one service don't cascade to others
- **Independent Development**: Teams can work autonomously on different services

3. **Supporting Evidence**
Industry leaders like Netflix, Amazon, and Uber have successfully implemented microservices to handle massive scale and complexity.

4. **Potential Limitations**
- Increased operational complexity
- Network latency between services
- Data consistency challenges

5. **Conclusion**
Microservices offer significant benefits for large-scale applications but require careful consideration of trade-offs."""


def generate_conversational_response(prompt: Prompt, query: str) -> str:
    """Generate a conversational-style response."""
    return f"""Hey! Great question about microservices! ðŸš€

So here's the thing - microservices are pretty awesome for a few key reasons:

**Main points:**
- You can scale individual parts of your app independently (super helpful!)
- Different teams can use different tech stacks for different services
- If one service goes down, the rest keep working
- Faster development cycles since teams aren't stepping on each other

**Real example:** Think about Netflix - they have hundreds of microservices. When their recommendation engine needs updating, they don't have to touch their video streaming service. Pretty cool, right?

**Why it matters:** As companies grow, monolithic apps become nightmares to maintain. Microservices let you break things down into manageable pieces.

The main trade-off? It's more complex to set up initially, but the long-term benefits are usually worth it for bigger projects."""


def generate_pros_cons_response(prompt: Prompt, query: str) -> str:
    """Generate a pros and cons analysis."""
    return f"""**Analysis: Microservices Architecture Benefits**

**PROS:**
1. **Independent Scaling** - Scale only the services that need it, saving resources
2. **Technology Flexibility** - Use the best tool for each specific job
3. **Fault Tolerance** - Service failures are isolated and don't crash the entire system
4. **Team Autonomy** - Different teams can work independently with minimal coordination
5. **Deployment Speed** - Deploy individual services without affecting others

**CONS:**
1. **Operational Complexity** - More services mean more monitoring, logging, and debugging
2. **Network Overhead** - Communication between services adds latency and potential failure points
3. **Data Management** - Distributed data consistency becomes challenging
4. **Testing Complexity** - Integration testing across multiple services is more difficult
5. **Initial Setup Cost** - Requires significant upfront investment in infrastructure

**CONCLUSION:**
Microservices are excellent for large, complex applications with multiple teams, but may be overkill for smaller projects. The benefits typically outweigh the costs for organizations at scale."""

    """Generate an expert interview-style response."""
    return f"""From my 15 years in enterprise architecture, I can tell you that microservices have been a game-changer.

The biggest win? **Independent scalability**. I've seen systems where one service handles 10x more traffic than others. With monoliths, you'd have to scale everything. With microservices, you scale what you need.

**Technology diversity** is another huge advantage. My team uses Go for high-performance services, Python for ML pipelines, and Node.js for real-time features. Try doing that with a monolith!

**Fault isolation** saved us countless times. When our recommendation service went down, users could still browse and purchase. Revenue kept flowing.

But here's the thing - it's not all sunshine. The **operational overhead** is real. You need solid DevOps practices, monitoring, and service mesh. We went from managing 3 deployments to 50+.

My advice? Start with a monolith, then extract services as you identify clear boundaries. Don't go microservices just because it's trendy - do it when you have the problems microservices solve."""
